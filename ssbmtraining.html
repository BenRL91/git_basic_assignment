<div>
  <p class="expl">Wavedashing is the act of air dodging downward at an agle towards the stage such that you dont leave the ground and instead slide across while remaining actionable. Wavedashing is an important part of the game. It opens up many different techniques such as wavelanding, invincible ledge dashing, as well as many approach and defense applications during neutral when understood. Keeping your wavedashes consistent as well as precise should be the goal during practice.
  </p>
 <ol>
   <li>Wavedash from one side of Final destination to the other 10 times. (back and forth is one)</li>
   <li>Full hop waveland onto Battlefield platforms. 20 times each side platform.</li>
   <li>Wavedash out of shield (oos) into a shine 20 times.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div> 
  <p class="expl">Dash dancing doesnt necessarily need as much practice as some of the more technical elements of movement, but a crisp dash dance done with intelligence can be a powerful element especially in neutral. The only real practice for dash dancing is done during matches against real opponents.
  </p>
  <p class="expl">
    Ledge Options make up a good portion of your recovery, whice is at minimum half of the game. You only lose when you don't stay on the stage, so anything you can do to get back onto the stage safely is essential to having successful gameplay.
 </p>
  <ol>
    <li>(Within 20XX Hack Pack) Turn on the hitbox visual mod in order to see when you are vulnerable and invulnerable. Successfully complete 20 invincible ledge dashes</li>
    <li>Dropdown shine with a perfect double jump sweetspot 20 times.</li>
    <li>From on stage wavedash back onto the ledge and hax dash 20 times</li>
  </ol>
<p class="expl">Off Stage Options are the tools that your character has in order to recover back onto the stage after being knocked off. Knowing when and how best to sweet spot or get back onto the stage safely is very important when considering if you don't get back...you die.
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Sweetspot the ledge from above 20 times</li>
    <li>Use the Fox Illusion (side special) shorten distances to sweetspot the ledge 10 times per distance.</li>
    <li>Sweetspot from below 15-20 times <strong>VERY DIFFICULT</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="bandb">Bread and Butter Combos</h3>
  <ul id="bandb-list">
    <li>Up throw to Up air</li>
    <li>Thunder's Combo</li>
    <li>Jab to Up smash</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <p class="expl">Up throw up air works on a good percentage of the cast, as well as being a main killer vs the Puff players who can't or don't know how to smash DI out of it.
  </p>
   <ol>
     <li>Up throw up air Marth from 0 or about 0 into 3 consecutive up airs 20 times.</li>
     <li>Up throw up air Puff at kill percent 20 times</li>
     <li>Test each member of the cast as you feel the need in order to find more percentages on more characters</li>
  </ol> 
<p class="expl">The Thunder's combo is an amazing starter against any character that falls down after being hit with a shine at low percent. It goes like this: Shine, wavedash, jab reset, up air, follow up... With this mastered, players who aren't ready or are caught off guard will be quickly brought up to about %50
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Practice the Thunder's combo on Fox and Falco from 0. Do that as many times as you can until you feel comfortable</li>
    <li>After feeling comfortable do as many full Thunder's combos into different follow-ups making sure to realize that the follow ups may differ slightly between the two spacies</li>
  </ol>
<p class="expl">The jab to up smash may not sound like much but it's definitely a powerful kill option as well as combo option vs some of the heavier characters and fast fallers. It sets up Peach, Samus, and sometimes Puff for certain death at the right percent.
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Practice the inputs without worrying about the percent of your opponent 20 times in order to feel the timing of performing the combo "on hit".</li>
    <li>After having the inputs down, practice on Peach and Samus at kill percent 20 times each</li>
    <li>If you're feeling confident, attempt 20 more times on a puff at kill percent</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="atech">Advanced Techniques
  </h3>
    <ul id="atech-list">
     <li>Shine to Grab</li>
     <li>Double Shine</li>
     <li>Waveshine Up-Smash</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <p class="expl">Shine grabbing is a very very strong part of shield pressure. If you can get up close, unless they can get away from your grab by somehow spot dodging or some other means, then shine grab beats shield every time.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Shine grab on air 20 times to get the hang of jump cancelling the grab out of the shine</li>
    <li>Go another 20 times on shield successfully</li>
    <li>Go another 20 times agains a non-shielding opponent in order to see which follow ups are possible on reaction after hitting the shine instead of getting the grab</li>
  </ol>
 <p class="expl">Double shining, while not as good as shine grabbing itself, in my opinion, is still strong if your're looking for a shine to hit instead of getting a grab to start or continue your offense. While being a fairly difficult technique, when mastered, it not only looks flashy, it's also very strong.
  </p>
 <ol>
   <li>Double shine on air 20 times</li>
   <li>Double shine on shield 20 times</li>
   <li>Double shine on hit (looking for follow ups) 20 times</li>
 </ol>
 <p class="expl">The waveshine up smash combines the waveshine with a kill move, which is just ridiculous all by itself. It works on characters that do not fall down after being hit with a shine. Peach, Gannon, Link to name a few. Linking multiple waveshines into an upsmash can be useful for not only getting KO's but if you happen to mess up, or your opponent does get out, they may already be off stage and primed for an edge guard.
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Waveshine Peach from one side of Final destination to the other 20 times.</li>
  <li>Waveshine out of shielding a Peach downsmash into an up smash 20 times</li>
  <li>Waveshine into grab up throw up air on Marth. (The up smash won't reach unless the Marth is caught not shielding or is DI'ing inward)</li>
 </ol>
